# Credit Card-Approval Prediction-Analysis with ETL using Airflow

## Background 
This data engineering project is designed to analyze Credit-Card-Application-Dashboard using the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process with Airflow workflow management tool. The aim is to assist organizations in enhancing the efficiency of the credit card approval process by leveraging the power of data processing and workflow automation.

## About The Data 
Credit scoring cards serve as a prevalent risk management technique within the financial sector. They leverage personal details and information provided by credit card applicants to forecast the likelihood of future defaults and credit card usage. Consequently, financial institutions are empowered to determine whether to extend credit card privileges to applicants. These credit scores offer an objective means to quantify the level of risk.

In essence, credit scoring cards rely on historical data. However, when confronted with significant economic fluctuations, previous models may diminish in their predictive capacity. Logistic regression emerges as a popular technique for credit scoring due to its aptitude for binary classification tasks and its capability to compute the coefficients of individual features. To streamline comprehension and operations, credit scoring cards often involve multiplying the logistic regression coefficients by a predetermined value (such as 100) and rounding them.
